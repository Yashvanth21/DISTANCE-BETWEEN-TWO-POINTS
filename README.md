# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Start the Prgoram
### Step 2: 
Get the input values as l1,l2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the required output
### Step 5: 
End of the Program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
l2=[10,6]
l1=[4,2]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
### OUTPUT:
![Exp 1 c](https://github.com/Yashvanth21/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/144979957/baf0948a-e9f7-4d56-a60e-ff3beccce2de)
### RESULT:
Thus the python program to calculate the distance between two points has been executed successfully.
